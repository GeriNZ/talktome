TalkToMe is designed to provide language learners an interactive platform to practice speaking in their target language. The bot uses a combination of advanced natural language processing algorithms to simulate a conversation, provide feedback on your proficiency, grammar, and vocabulary usage.

**Note:** This tool is intended for practice and should not be used as a sole method for learning a language. The bot's feedback is based on algorithms and may not always reflect human judgment.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know.
