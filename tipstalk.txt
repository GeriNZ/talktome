When speaking, your choice of vocabulary impacts the message, its context, and its pronunciation. Choosing words you’re comfortable with when conversing will help improve your language proficiency. Therefore, try to select each word carefully and deliberately, keeping the message of your sentence in mind.
Good pronunciation is essentially the most important element for speaking and understanding a language. The more you practice, the better your pronunciation will become over time. After all, practice makes better!
The more you listen to the language you are learning, the more familiar you become about using appropriate words according to the situation you’re in.
Using long speeches and recording them at the same time will enable you to gauge fluency in the language you are learning and come back to it at a later time for review. This also improves confidence while communicating in the language you are learning.
